### 2. Reproduce Results

We highly encourage to check basic tutorials to get started with the ML-Agents. After opening the VR-Caps-Unity-RL project open the RL_scene_stomach scene which includes a capsule agent, a stomach 3D model and the script(CoverageAgent.cs). You can see that the trained model (CoverageBrain.nn) is already attached as a component to the capsule. So, you can just run the play mode and it will start scanning the stomach.

In order to train a new model, please follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-ML-Agents.md) and make necessary adjustments in the behaviour parameters.
